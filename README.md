This script creates a table named staff to store employee details like ID, age, name, location, and salary.

It inserts 5 sample records of different employees into the staff table.

A view called staff_above_35000 is created to show only those employees whose salary is more than 35,000.

The view helps to easily fetch filtered staff data without running the full query again.

Finally, it selects and displays the records from the view.
